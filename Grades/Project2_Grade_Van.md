## Evaluation Criteria

|  Criteria | Comment | Grade (%) |
|---|---|
| Meets Requirements  | (see above) | 100% |
| Correctness  | Once again, incredible work. The complexity and length of code is quite impressive. Excellent work!! So glad you used D3! <br><br>Minor: I'm not sure if you needed to / why you redefined Math.map(). Seems to me that Math.normalize() and denormalize() are redundant if you use the original Math.map(). but maybe I'm missing something.<br><br>Love that you wrote your own sorting algorithm! There is so much to talk about with sorting algorithms.<br><br>Great error checking!<br><br>I could blabber for a while, and I'm not sure you'll even read it! The gist is, you did great work!  |  97%   |
| Design and Style |  Love the use of Bootstrap!! And the use of D3! Looks so sleek! Maybe just some margins. And move the top circle down a bit so it isn't cropped.<br><br>Since you have some meaty functions/object constructors, it'd be nice to have a solid comment above the function that helps me figure out what it's doing.  | 96% |
| Creativity |  Great job! The only issue here is the lack of clear communication about what the data is illustrating. Additional labels- what does the progress represent- an additional speech? Which speech? When? Where are they coming from?<br><br>More importantly, what does the "vs. the newer speech" mean? Are the word frequencies subtracted? Make sure to make the presentation clear to your audience in order to communicate your point.  | 95%  |
| Effort | Excellent job!  | 98%  |
