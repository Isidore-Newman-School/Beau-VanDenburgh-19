# TED Talk Grade

### Topic: That weird JavaScript thing!

|  Requirement | Comment |
|---|---|
| <strong>Time</strong>- <br> 4 to 6 min  | >15 min |
| <strong>Visual materials</strong> (images, slides, video < 1 min) submitted to Ms. deBB at least one day before the presentation  | Excellent use of slides. I like how you animated the bullet points to pop up one at a time. Made it easy to follow your arguments. |
| <strong>Bibliography</strong> slide or document with links to sources | n/a |
| <strong>Content</strong>: Informative, Relevant, Engaging  | Excellent explanation. Thorough and clear. I might consider giving the demo of the app at the beginning so that students have a better understanding of what you're ending up. |
| <strong>Delivery:</strong> <br>Professional: Speaks clearly, appropriate eye contact <br><br>Well-prepared: Doesnâ€™t rely heavily on notes, smooth transitions, etc.  | Excellent. Knowledgable and clear. The only reason you're losing points here is because the talk was way over the time limit. It's important to know your audience, prep your talk, and identify where it's important to cut or skip material. But otherwise, very good talk. |

Great!!!
